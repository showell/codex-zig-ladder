# Verified plug transfer.
#
# The guest drops the last byte of any odd-length frame: net-recv-raw derives
# its REP INSW word count with `shr rcx, 1`, which rounds down, and returns
# the full length anyway, so the caller reads one stale byte left by the
# previous frame. Silent -- the plug still reports "OK defs=N" and emits
# plausible source with a mangled identifier. See
# NewRepository/deck-record-repro/PLUG_IR_TRANSPORT.md.
#
# So we do not vote, we prove. Frame parity follows TCP payload parity
# (headers are even), plug_run keeps every write even and pads the wire total
# to even, and afterwards we read the capture back and require that no
# host->guest frame had an odd body. No odd frame means this defect cannot
# have fired.
#
# The old two-chunk-sizes-must-agree route is kept as a fallback. It is
# several times more expensive and only ever gave a vote, but it does not
# depend on our reading of the mechanism being right.
