# Generate LirHarness.codex + LirStubs.codex for the lir milestone: the
# first back-half rung. Unlike the front-half rungs there is no source
# subject and no self-reference -- X86_64Lir is instruction selection, so
# the harness hand-builds LirFunc programs, runs lir-emit-func over a
# fresh CodegenState, and prints the emitted machine-code bytes. The
# byte list IS the oracle output.

 The functions below are data, chosen to reach the selector's branches:
 ALU on registers and immediates, a compare feeding a conditional branch,
 a spilled destination, the fixed-register remainder, and per-arm returns
 (rets = True) so each path carries its own epilogue.

 The real X86_64Builtins.codex cannot be bundled -- its table is typed
 over the whole tree emitter -- and empty-codegen-state reads these two
 names. Empty is honest here: the harness drives lir-emit-func directly
 and nothing on that path consults a builtin.

Section: Stubs

   name : Text

 Faithful copies from unbundled pages of the X86-64 Code Generator
 chapter, kept byte-for-byte with their originals so the subject's
 behavior is the compiler's: tco-list-contains from X86_64Compound,
 emit-call-to from X86_64, buf-write-i32 from X86_64Chapter.

 THE TARGET-SELECTION CONSTANTS, new work at Update 54. X86_64State's
 st-load-base, st-heap-base and st-base each branch on st-windows, and
 the addresses they choose between live on pages this bundle does not
 carry -- four in X86_64Boot, bare-metal-heap-base in X86_64Chapter.
 Only the bare-metal arm is ever taken here; the others must merely
 resolve.

 THE PAGES WERE TRIED FIRST AND THE ANSWER WAS NO, measured 2026-09-02.
 X86_64Boot + X86_64Chapter left three names open (X86_64IO); adding
 that left SIXTEEN across X86_64, X86_64Compound, X86_64Helpers and
 CdxWriter. That closure is ir_to_x86's bundle -- 2.4 MB against this
 rung's 489 KB -- so taking the pages deletes the reason this rung
 exists, which is to be the small back-half slice with no front end.
 Stubbing five Integers keeps the slice.

 The cost is that a VALUE can drift at the next Update while this still
 compiles. That is the standing cost of every copy above, and the
 reason each one names its origin.
