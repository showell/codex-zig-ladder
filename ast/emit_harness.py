"""The back-end harness, shared by every rung that compiles a subject all the
way to a CDX binary.

The driver is the compiler's own entry point, x86-64-emit-cdx, and the output
is what it returns: the symbol map, then header-bytes, the content buffer and
tail-bytes, 32 to a line. Nothing here decides anything about emission -- the
whole point is that the rung runs the real thing, so a copied driver that
could drift is exactly what this is not.

**A harness takes a LIST of subjects and runs each one.** That is the fix for a
conflation the ladder shipped with: a rung is a claim, a unit is a compile, and
they were the same word. `scale` compiled the same 2.4 MB unit as `fibx` and
`clamp` the same 2.58 MB unit as `whole`, differing only in a Text literal, so
the ladder paid for four compiles to ask four questions of two binaries.
Compiling the unit is 80-90 per cent of what a big rung costs (measured, sweep
of 2026-08-17), so the second question was costing almost as much as the first
and learning nothing new about the compiler.

The pipeline therefore moves into `run-<prefix>`, a function of the subject
text, called once per subject with a delimiter line between the dumps. That
shape was not invented here: gen_zigc_harness.py has run pipeline_source over a
bound `src` since the hosted compiler existed.

What this costs is fault isolation, and it is worth naming. Two dumps from one
process means a fault in the first subject takes the second down with it, where
two rungs used to fail independently -- and that mattered exactly once, when
clamp faulted and whole was still measured. The delimiter is what buys most of
it back: a truncated run names the subject it died in.

# The three pieces below are shared with the front-end rungs, whose harnesses
# predate this file and write their own pipelines. Those rungs bundle only the
# front end on purpose -- being cheap is what earns them their place low on the
# ladder -- so they cannot take frontend_source whole. They can take these,
# because every chapter the three need is already in all four bundles.

# opening.codex:442 opens with `let mountain-base = init-phase-allocator`, and
# this is not only about setting the deck cell. X86_64Chapter.codex:1147 decides
# whether deck-record is the intrinsic or an ordinary function:
#
#   pa-slug = def-chapter-slug defs-lifted "init-phase-allocator" ...
#   dr-slug = def-chapter-slug defs-lifted "deck-record" ...
#   deck-record-intrinsic = (pa-slug /= "" & pa-slug == dr-slug)
#
# A harness that never calls init-phase-allocator leaves it unreachable, IR
# emission prunes it, pa-slug comes back "", and the flag is False. Then
# deck-record is emitted as what it looks like -- `mov rax,rdi ; ret`, four
# bytes -- and every value the compiler wraps in it to survive emit-all-defs's
# per-function __heap-restore is freed at that boundary instead. bag-add wraps
# both its cons cell and its record, so the second diagnostic a compile records
# walks a dangling spine: that is clamp's RDI=0 into __list_snoc.
#
# Naming it is the whole job -- the marker has to be in the unit. It is
# __heap-save + __deck-set, so the zig arm emits it without trouble.
#
# The reservation has to follow immediately, and cover the whole run rather than
# sit in front of emission. init-phase-allocator points the deck cell at the
# current heap top and bivy carries on from the same address, so with the
# intrinsic live the first deck-record extent would allocate on top of the parse
# and check data still in use. opening.codex never leaves that window open:
# `build lex-deck-height` is line 444, two lines after the init at 442. Ours is
# one region for every phase instead of the driver's thirteen, which is the part
# of its shape a harness can skip.
#
# build's body is inlined rather than cited because build also reaches
# deck-reservation-guard -> poke-byte, and poke-byte has no ZigEmitter entry:
# citing it would make the builtin reachable and break the zig arm. The guard
# pokes the boot stack's guard page, which a reservation this size does not come
# near.
#
# demand-lift-floor is 104 MB against the 1 GB the harness runs in. It is a
# first number, not a measured one: the deck scales the rungs run at were all
# chosen while the intrinsic was off and nothing allocated on the deck at all,
# so there is nothing to size against. Too small shows up as CDX9002 or a fault,
# which is the honest direction to be wrong in.

# arith's gauge is `(Gauge { g = n }).g`. Lowering an AFieldAccess lowers its

# lookup-type-split for "Gauge", the env-side entry is missing, and ctor-raw

# emission. emit-field-access resolved that to no record type and refused with a
# ud2, exactly as it should. Nothing was unresolved; the name was never in the
# table to resolve.
#

 header-bytes and tail-bytes arrive as lists rather than in the workspace,
 so they need their own walker; splitting on the source of the bytes rather
 than on what they mean keeps both walkers dumb.

  {prefix}-list-line (bs) (i) (hi) (acc) =

 The symbol map is what the real compiler writes beside a .cdx, and it is
 the only thing that says which bytes are which. It goes through the oracle
 too: a plug that emitted the code correctly but scrambled the map would
 still be wrong.

 A count says a compile went wrong; the messages say what. This prints the
 bag itself so a rung that fails is a rung that explains itself, which is
 the difference between "emit-errors 72" and a diagnosis.

 emit-diags is the length of the same list, printed as a number, because a
 walker that emits nothing and a list that holds nothing look identical and
 the first reading of this had no control to tell them apart.

 The bag gates the byte sections, the way emit-binary-tail gates them on
 bag-has-errors. A compile that recorded an error has ALREADY refused: when
 emit-field-access cannot resolve a record type it emits ud2 where the load
 belonged, deliberately. Printing those bytes anyway produced a binary that
 traps at runtime and a rung that compared two crash dumps -- the harness
 shipping something the compiler had rejected.
