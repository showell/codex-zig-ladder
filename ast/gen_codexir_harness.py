"""Generate CodexIrHarness.codex: the compiler as a program that emits IR.

zigc emits a CDX, which is what the Codex compiler is for. This emits IR-CCE
instead, which is what the PLUG is fed -- and that is the piece that takes the
seed out of the pipeline. With this and ZigEmitHosted, the chain

    prog.codex -> prog.ir -> prog.zig -> ELF

is three native processes and no VM at all.

The driver is emit-ir-cce's own sequence (opening.codex ~1694), minus the deck
and heap accounting and using the whole-text form rather than the streaming
one: a hosted process has no reason to avoid materialising the text, and
ir-print-defs exists to avoid exactly that.

Two things it must not skip, because they decide what the IR CONTAINS:

  ir-prune-unreachable-roots  -- the IR is what is reachable from the roots,
                                 not every def in the unit
  emit-ir-chapter's meta      -- chapter title, prose, section titles, ctor
                                 names, prose blocks, annotations and ground
                                 effects all ride the text wire

ir-emit-roots is copied from opening.codex:1316 rather than cited, because
opening.codex cannot be bundled beside a harness that defines `opening`. If
that list changes upstream, this copy is wrong and the IR will be missing a
root -- which is the cost of standing in for the driver.
