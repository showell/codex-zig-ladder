"""Generate ScopeHarness.codex: an opening that parses an embedded codex
chapter, desugars it, scopes and resolves it, and dumps the result. The dump
is deliberately structural rather than pretty -- it exists to be diffed
between the bare-metal and zig arms, so every line must be derivable from
the AChapter alone.

The parse half of the dump is kept verbatim from the parse harness. It is
not redundant: if a desugar diff appears, the first question is whether
the CST going in was already different, and having both halves in one run
answers that without a second experiment."""
