"""The two roots the ladder needs, resolved in one place.

Every script here used to derive its roots by walking a fixed number of
directories up from itself, which worked only because the ladder sat inside the
Codex checkout: the ladder root was `..` and the checkout was `../..`. Ninety-odd
sites did that, and they already disagreed -- src/gen_scale_harness.py walked two
levels and src/gen_check_harness.py walked three, meaning one of them wanted the
ladder and the other wanted the checkout, and nothing said which.

Once the ladder lives in its own repository the two are unrelated paths, so the
level count cannot encode the answer any more. Both roots are named here instead,
and a caller says which one it means.

LADDER is where this file is: the ladder's own tree, always known.

CODEX is the checkout under test. It comes from $CODEX_ROOT when that is set --
which is how one ladder gets pointed at several Updates in turn -- and otherwise
from the first directory at or above LADDER that looks like a checkout. Nothing
is guessed: a directory qualifies only by holding the compiler's driver, and a
failed search raises rather than falling back to a plausible-looking path. A
ladder silently pointed at the wrong checkout would bank truth against a seed
nobody named, which is the one failure this whole exercise exists to prevent.
